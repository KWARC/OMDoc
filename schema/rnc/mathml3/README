This directory contains slightly modified versions of the 
MathML3 RelaxNG Schema for inclusion in the OMDoc schema.
See the documentation at http://www.omdoc.org
 
The only difference to the official schemata is the introduction 
of an additional top-level schema: mathml3-elemental, which extends 
mathml3-strict by the content elements (it is just shorter to write).
