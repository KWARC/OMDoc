This SVN directory contains slightly modified versions of the 
MathML3 RelaxNG Schema for inclusion in the OMDoc schema. It is
also intended as an SVN external for inclusion into other schemata. 

The only difference to the official schemata is the introduction 
of an additional top-level schema: mathml3-elemental, which extends 
mathml3-strict by the content elements (it is just shorter to write).
