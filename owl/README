== OMDoc document ontology ==

Note: 
As of 2010-01-08, the *.omdoc files (OMDoc) are the authoritative source.  The
*.n3 files (Turtle) are left for validating the OMDocâ†’OWL translation of the
ontology, which remains to be set up here.

The ontology is designed in a modular way.  For exchange, it is more convenient
to have it in one file.  This file is available in www/omdoc.owl (RDF/XML) and
generated via make (currently from the *.n3 files, soon from the *.omdoc files).

Please see http://mathweb.org/wiki/OMDoc/document_ontology for further
documentation.

== OMDoc 1.6 information ==

The tools that currently support the OMDoc ontology use OMDoc 1.3.  The most
recent version of the ontology can thus be found at
https://svn.omdoc.org/repos/omdoc/branches/omdoc-1.3/owl.  Updates will be
merged into the trunk every once a while.
