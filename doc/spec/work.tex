  \DCMabstract{The {\omdoc} (\underline{O}pen \underline{M}athematical
    \underline{Doc}uments) format is a content markup scheme for (collections of)
    mathematical documents including articles, textbooks, interactive books, and courses.
    {\omdoc} also serves as the content language for agent communication of mathematical
    services on a mathematical software bus.

    This document is the specification of {\vomdoc{1.6}} of the {\omdoc} format, the first
    step towards {\omdocv2}. It defines the {\omdoc} language features and their
    meaning. The content of this part is normative for the {\omdoc} format; an {\omdoc}
    document is valid as an {\omdoc} document, iff it meets all the constraints imposed
    here. {\omdoc} applications will normally presuppose valid {\omdoc} documents and only
    exhibit the intended behavior on such.}
