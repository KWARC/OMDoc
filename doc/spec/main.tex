  \DCMabstract{The {\omdoc} (\explainomdocacronym) format is a content markup scheme for
    (collections of) mathematical documents including articles, textbooks, interactive
    books, and courses.  {\omdoc} also serves as the content language for agent
    communication of mathematical services on a mathematical software bus.

    This document is the specification of {\vomdoc{1.6}} of the {\omdoc} format, the first
    step towards {\omdocv2}. It defines the {\omdoc} language features and their
    meaning. The content of this part is normative for the {\omdoc} format; an {\omdoc}
    document is valid as an {\omdoc} document, iff it meets all the constraints imposed
    here. {\omdoc} applications will normally presuppose valid {\omdoc} documents and only
    exhibit the intended behavior on such.}
