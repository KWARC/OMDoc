\begin{module}[id=document-model]
\begin{omgroup}[id=document-model]{Document Models for OMDoc}

In almost all {\xml} applications, there is a tension between the document view and the
object view of data; after all, {\xml} is a document-oriented interoperability framework
for exchanging data objects. The question, which view is the correct one for {\xml} in
general is hotly debated among {\xml} theorists. In {\omdoc}, actually both views make
sense in various ways. Mathematical documents are the objects we try to formalize, they
contain knowledge about mathematical objects that are encoded as formulae, and we arrive
at content markup for mathematical documents by treating knowledge fragments (statements
and theories) as objects in their own right that can be inspected and reasoned about.

In {\srefl{mobj}{quiz}}, we have defined what {\omdoc} documents look like and motivated
this by the mathematical objects they encode. But we have not really defined the
properties of these documents as objects themselves (\inlinedef{we will speak of the
  {\omdoc} {\twindef{document}{object model}} ({\indextoo{OMDOM}})}). To get a feeling for
the issues involved, let us take stock of what we mean by the object view of data. In
mathematics, when we define a class of mathematical objects (e.g.  vector spaces), we have
to say which objects belong to this class, and when they are to be considered equal (e.g.
vector spaces are equal, iff they are isomorphic). When defining the intended behavior of
operations, we need to care only about objects of this class, and we can only make use of
properties that are invariant under object equality. In particular, we cannot use
properties of a particular realization of a vector space that are not preserved under
isomorphism. For document models, we do the same, only that the objects are documents.


\begin{omgroup}[id=xml-DOM]{XML Document Models}
\begin{module}[id=XMLDom]

{\xml} supports the task of defining a particular class of documents (e.g. the class of
{\omdoc} documents) with formal grammars such as the {\twintoo{document type}{definition}}
({\indextoo{DTD}}) or an {\xml} \twinalt{schema}{XML}{schema}, that can be used for
mechanical document validation.  Surprisingly, {\xml} leaves the task of specifying
document equality to be clarified in the (informal) specifications, such as this {\omdoc}
specification. As a consequence, current practice for {\xml}
\twinalt{applications}{application}{XML} is quite varied. For instance, the {\openmath}
standard (see~\cite{BusCapCar:2oms04} and {\sref{openmath}}) gives a mathematical
object model for {\openmath} objects that is specified independently of the {\xml}
encoding. Other {\xml} applications like e.g.  presentation
{\mathml}~\cite{CarIon:MathML03} or {\xhtml}~\cite{W3C:xhtml2000} specify models in form
of the intended screen presentation, while still others like the
{\xslt}~\cite{Clark:xslt99} give the operational semantics.

For a formal definition
\begin{definition}[display=flow,id=document-model.def]
  let $\cK$ be a set of documents. We take a {\twindef{document}{model}} to be a partial
  equivalence relation\footnote{A partial equivalence relation is a symmetric transitive
    relation. We will use $[d]_\cX$ for the {\twindef{equivalence}{class}} of $d$, i.e.
    $[d]_\cX\colon=\{e|d{\cX}e\}$ $\cX$ on documents, such that $\{d|d{\cX}d\}=\cK$}. In
  particular, a relation $\cX$ is an equivalence relation on $\cK$.  For a given document
  model $\cX$, let us say that two documents $d$ and $d'$ are {\defemph{$\cX$-equal}}, iff
  $d{\cX}d'$. We call a property $p$ $\cX$-{\defin{invariant}}, iff for all $d{\cX}d'$,
  $p$ holds on $d$ whenever $p$ holds on $d'$.
\end{definition}

A possible source of confusion is that documents can admit more than one document model
(see~\cite{KohKoh:esmk05} for an exploration of possible document models for
mathematics). Concretely, {\omdoc} documents admit the {\omdoc} document model that we
will specify in section {\sref{omdom}} and also the following four {\xml} document
models that can be restricted to {\omdoc} documents (as a relation).\footnote{Here we
  follow Eliotte Rusty Harold's classification of layers of {\xml} processing
  in~\cite{Harold:ex03}, where he distinguishes the binary, lexical, sequence, structure,
  and semantic layer, the latter being the document model of the {\xml} application}
\begin{description}
\item[The {\twintoo{binary}{document model}}] interprets files as sequences of
  bytes.  Two documents are equal, iff they are equal as byte sequence. This
  is the most concrete and fine-grained (and thus weakest) document model
  imaginable.
\item[The {\atwintoo{lexical}{document}{model}}] interprets binary files as sequences of
  {\indextoo{Unicode}} characters~\cite{Unicode:tuc03} using an encoding table.  Two files
  may be considered equal by this document model even though they differ as binary files,
  if they have different encodings that map the byte sequences to the same sequence of
  {\unicode} characters.
\item[The \atwinalt{{\xml} syntax document model}{XML}{syntax}{document model}] interprets
  {\unicode} Files as sequences consisting of an {\xml} declaration, a DOCTYPE
  declaration, tags, entity references, character references, CDATA sections, PCDATA
  comments, and processing instructions. At this level, for instance, whitespace
  characters between {\xml} tags are irrelevant, and {\xml} documents may be considered
  the same, if they are different as {\unicode} sequences.
\item[The \atwinalt{{\xml} structure document model}{XML}{structure}{document model}]
  interprets documents as {\xml} trees of elements, attributes, text nodes, processing
  instructions, and sometimes comments. In this document model the order of attribute
  declarations in {\xml} elements is immaterial, double and single quotes can be used
  interchangeably for strings, and {\xml} \twinalt{comments}{XML}{comment}
  (\snippetin{<\char33--}\ldots\snippetin{-->}) are ignored.
\end{description}
Each of these document models, is suitable for different applications, for instance the
lexical document model is the appropriate one for {\indextoo{Unicode}}-aware editors that
interpret the encoding string in the {\xml} declaration and present the appropriate glyphs
to the user, while the binary document model would be appropriate for a simple ASCII
editor. Since the last three document models are refinements of the {\xml} document model,
we will recap this in the next section and define the {\omdoc} document model in
{\sref{omdom}}.

To get a feeling for the issues involved, let us compare the {\omdoc} elements in
{\mylstlref{first}{third}} below. For instance, the serialization in {\mylstref{second}}
is {\xml}-equal to the one in {\mylstref{first}}, but not to the one in
{\mylstref{third}}.

\begin{lstlisting}[escapechar=\%,label=lst:first,
   index={definition,OMA},caption={An {\omdoc} Definition}]
<docalt>
  <definition xml:id="comm.def.en" for="comm">
    <h:p xml:lang="en">

\end{omgroup}

\begin{omgroup}[id=omdom]{The OMDoc Document Model}
\begin{module}[id=omdom]

The {\omdoc} document model extends the {\xml} structure document model in various ways.
We will specify the equality relation in the table below, and discuss a few general issues
here.

The {\omdoc} document model is guided by the notion of content markup for mathematical
documents. Thus, two document fragments will only be considered equal, if they have the
same abstract structure. For instance, the order of children of an {\element{docalt}}
element is irrelevant, since they form a {\twintoo{multilingual}{group}} which form the
base for multilingual text assembly. Other facets of the {\omdoc} document model are
motivated by presentation-independence, for instance the distribution of whitespace is
irrelevant even in text nodes, to allow formatting and reflow in the source code, which is
not considered to change the information content of a text.

\begin{lstlisting}[escapechar=\%,label=lst:third,
   index={definition,docalt,OMA},
   caption={An {\omdoc}-Equal Representation for {\mylstsref{first}{second}}}]
<docalt>
  <definition xml:id="comm.def.de" for="comm">
    <h:p xml:lang="de">Eine Operation <OMR href="#op"/> 
      hei%\ss%t kommutativ, falls 
      <OMA id="comm1"><OMS cd="relation1" name="eq"/>
        <OMA><OMV name="op"/><OMV name="X"/><OMV name="Y"/></OMA>
        <OMA><OMV name="op"/><OMV name="Y"/><OMV name="X"/></OMA>
      </OMA>
      f%\"u%r alle <OMR href="#x"/> und <OMR href="#y"/>.
  </h:p>
  </definition>
  <definition xml:id="comm.def.en" for="#comm">
    <h:p xml:lang="en">
      An operation <OMV id="op" name="op"/> is called commutative, 
      iff <OMR href="#comm1"/> for all <OMV id="x" name="X"/> and 
      <OMV id="y" name="Y"/>.
    </h:p>
  </definition>
</docalt>
\end{lstlisting}

Compared to other document models, this is a rather weak (but general) notion of
equality. Note in particular, that the {\omdoc} document model does {\emph{not}}
use mathematical equality here, which would make the formula $X+Y=Y+X$ (the
{\element[ns-elt=om]{OMA}} with {\snippet{xml:id="comm1"}} in
{\mylstref{third}} instantiated with addition for {\snippetin{op}}) mathematically
equal to the trivial condition $X+Y=X+Y$, obtained by exchanging the right hand
side $Y+X$ of the equality by $X+Y$, which is mathematically equal (but not
{\omdoc}-equal).

Let us now specify (part of) the equality relation by the rules in the table in
{\myfigref{omdom}}.  We have discussed a machine-readable form of these equality
constraints in the {\xml} schema for {\omdoc} in~\cite{KohAng:tccmvc03}.

\begin{myfig}{omdom}{The {\omdoc} Document Model}
\begin{scriptsize}
\begin{tabular}{|l|p{1.2truecm}|p{5.5truecm}|p{3cm}|}\hline
  \#& Rule & comment & elements \\\hline\hline
  1 & unordered
  & The order of children of this element is irrelevant (as far as permitted by
  the content model). For instance only the order of {\element{obligation}}
  elements in the {\element{axiom-inclusion}} element  is arbitrary, since the
  others must precede them in the content model. 
  & {\element{adt}} {\element{axiom-inclusion}} {\element{metadata}}
  {\element{symbol}} {\element{code}} {\element{private}} {\element{presentation}}
  {\element{omstyle}}\\\hline
  2 & multi-group 
  & The order between siblings elements does not matter, as long as the values of
  the key attributes differ. 
  & {\element{requation}} {\element[ns-elt=dc]{description}}
  {\element{sortdef}} {\element{data}}   {\element[ns-elt=dc]{title}} {\element{solution}} \\\hline 
  3 & DAG encoding 
  & \atwinalt{Directedacyclicgraphs}{directed}{acyclic}{graph} built up using
    {\element[ns-elt=om]{OMR}} elements are equal, iff their {\twintoo{tree}{expansion}s}
    are equal.  
  & {\element[ns-elt=om]{OMR}} {\element{ref}}     \\\hline   
  4 & Dataset 
  & If the content of the {\element[ns-elt=dc]{type}} element is {\snippetin{Dataset}}, then
  the order of the siblings of the parent {\element{metadata}} element is
  irrelevant. 
  & {\element[ns-elt=dc]{type}} \\\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{scriptsize}
\end{myfig}

The last rule in {\myfigref{omdom}} is probably the most interesting, as we have seen in
{\sref{omdoc-infrastructure}}, {\omdoc} documents have both formal and informal aspects,
they can contain {\emph{\indextoo{narrative}}} as well as
{\emph{\indextoo{narrative-structured}}} information.  The latter kind of document
contains a formalization of a mathematical theory, as a reference for automated theorem
proving systems. There, logical dependencies play a much greater role than the order of
serialization in mathematical objects.  \inlinedef{We call such documents {\defin{content
      OMDoc}}} and specify the value {\snippetin{Dataset}} in the
{\element[ns-elt=dc]{type}} element of the {\omdoc} metadata for such documents.  On the
other extreme we have human-oriented presentations of mathematical knowledge, e.g.  for
educational purposes, where didactic considerations determine the order of
presentation. \inlinedef{We call such documents {\defin{narrative-structured}}} and
specify this by the value {\snippetin{Text}} (also see the discussion in
{\sref{dc-elements}})
\end{module}
\end{omgroup}

\begin{omgroup}[id=sub-languages]{OMDoc Sub-Languages}
\begin{module}[id=sub-languages]

  In the last chapters we have described the {\omdoc} modules. Together, they make up the
  {\omdoc} document format, a very rich format for marking up the content of a wide
  variety of mathematical documents. (see {\extref{primer}{all}} for some worked
  examples). Of course not all documents need the full breadth of {\omdoc} functionality,
  and on the other hand, not all {\omdoc} applications (see {\extref{projects}{all}} for
  examples) support the whole language.

One of the advantages of a modular language design is that it becomes easy to address this
situation by specifying sub-languages that only include part of the functionality. We will
discuss plausible {\omdoc} sub-languages and their applications that can be obtained by
dropping optional modules from {\omdoc}.  {\myfigref{omdoc-sub-languages}} visualizes the
sub-languages we will present in this chapter. The full language {\omdoc} is at the top,
at the bottom is a minimal sub-language {\omdoc} Basic, which only contains the required
modules (mathematical documents without them do not really make sense). The arrows signify
language inclusion and are marked with the modules acquired in the extension.

\end{myfig}

The sub-language identifiers can be used as values of the {\attributeshort{modules}}
attribute on the {\element{omdoc}} and {\element{omdoc}} elements. Used there, they
abbreviate the list of modules these sub-languages contain.


\begin{omgroup}[id=sub-languages.basic]{Basic {\omdoc}}

Basic {\omdoc} is sufficient for very simple mathematical documents that do not introduce
new symbols or concepts, or for early (and non-specific) stages in the migration process
from legacy representations of mathematical material (see {\sref{top-level}}). This
{\omdoc} sub-language consists of five modules: we need module {\MOBJmodule{spec}} for
mathematical objects and formulae, which are present in almost all mathematical documents.
Module {\DOCmodule{spec}} provides the document infrastructure, and in particular, the
root \twinalt{element}{document}{root} {\element{omdoc}}. We need {\METAmodule{spec}} for
titles, descriptions, and administrative metadata, and module {\MTXTmodule{spec}} so we
can state properties about the mathematical objects in {\element{omtext}} element.
Finally, module {\RTmodule{spec}} allows to structured text below the {\element{omtext}}
level. This module is not strictly needed for basic {\omdoc}, but we have included it for
convenience.
\end{omgroup}

\begin{omgroup}[id=sub-languages.cd]{{\omdoc} Content Dictionaries}

Content Dictionaries are used to define the meaning of {\indextoo{symbol}s} in the
{\openmath} standard~\cite{BusCapCar:2oms04}, they are the mathematical documents referred
to in the {\attribute{cd}{OMS}} attribute of the {\element[ns-elt=om]{OMS}} element.  To
express \twinalt{contentdictionaries}{content dictionary}{OMDoc} in {\omdoc}, we need to
add the module {\STmodule{spec}} to Basic {\omdoc}.  It provides the possibility to
specify the meaning of basic mathematical objects ({\indextoo{symbol}s}) by
{\indextoo{axiom}s} and {\indextoo{definition}s} together with the infrastructure for
inheritance, and grouping, and allows to reference the symbols defined via their home
theory (see the discussion in {\sref{theories-contexts}}).
  
With this extension alone, {\omdoc} content dictionaries add support for
{\twintoo{multilingual}{text}}, simple {\indextoo{inheritance}} for theories, and
{\twintoo{document}{structure}} to the functionality of {\openmath} content
dictionaries. Furthermore, {\omdoc} content dictionaries allow the conceptual separation
of mathematical properties into {\indextoo{constitutive}} ones and
{\twintoo{logically}{redundant}} ones. The latter of these are not strictly essential for
content dictionaries, but enhance maintainability and readability, they are included in
{\openmath} content dictionaries for documentation and explanation.

The sub-language for {\omdoc} content dictionaries also allows the specification of
notations for the introduced symbols (by module {\PRESmodule{spec}}). So the resulting
documents can be used for referencing (as in {\openmath}) and as a resource for deriving
presentation information for the symbols defined here.  To get a feeling for this
sub-language, see the example in the {\omdoc} variant of the {\openmath} content
dictionary {\snippetin{arith1}} in {\sref{omcds}}, which shows that the {\openmath}
content dictionary format is (isomorphic to) a subset of the {\omdoc} format. In fact, the
{\openmath}2 standard only presents the content dictionary format used here as one of many
encodings and specifies abstract conditions on content dictionaries that the {\omdoc}
encoding below also meets.  Thus {\omdoc} is a valid content dictionary encoding.
\end{omgroup}

\begin{omgroup}[id=sub-languages.spec]{Specification {\omdoc}}

{\omdoc} content dictionaries are still a relatively lightweight format for the
specification of meaning of mathematical symbols and objects. Large scale formal
specification efforts, e.g. for program verification need more structure to be
practical. Specification languages like {\casl} (Common Algebraic
\indexalt{Specification}{specification} Language~\cite{CoFI:2004:CASL-RM}) offer the necessary
infrastructure, but have a syntax that is not integrated with web standards.

The Specification {\omdoc} sub-language adds the modules {\ADTmodule{spec}} and
{\CTHmodule{spec}} to the language of {\omdoc} content dictionaries. The resulting
language is equivalent to the {\casl} standard,
see~\cite{AutHut:tefsduc00,Hutter:mocsv00,MAH-06-a} for the necessary theory.

The structured definition schemata from module {\ADTmodule{spec}} allow to specify
{\twintoo{abstract}{data type}s}, sets of objects that are inductively defined from
constructor symbols. The {\twintoo{development}{graph}} structure built on the
{\twintoo{theory}{morphism}s} from module {\CTHmodule{spec}} allow to make inclusion
assertions about theories that structure fragments of mathematical developments and
support a \twintoo{Management of}{change}.
\end{omgroup}

\begin{omgroup}[id=sub-languages.mathwebomdoc]{MathWeb {\omdoc}}

{\omdoc} can be used as a content-oriented basis for web publishing of
mathematics. Documents for the web often contain images, applets, code fragments,
and other data, together with mathematical statements and theories.

The {\omdoc} sub-language {\twinalt{MathWeb {\omdoc}}{MathWeb} {OMDoc}} extends the
language for {\omdoc} content dictionaries by the module {\EXTmodule{spec}}, which adds
infrastructure for images, applets, code fragments, and other data.
\end{omgroup}

\begin{omgroup}[id=sub-languages.edu]{Educational {\omdoc}}

{\omdoc} is currently used as a content-oriented basis for various systems for mathematics
education (see e.g. {\extref{primer}{courseware}} for an example and discussion).  The {\omdoc}
sub-language \twinalt{Educational {\omdoc}}{Educational}{OMDoc} extends MathWeb {\omdoc}
by the module {\QUIZmodule{spec}}, which adds infrastructure for exercises and
assessments.
\end{omgroup}
\end{module}

\begin{omgroup}[id=spec-intro.reusing]{Reusing {\omdoc} modules in other formats}

Another application of the modular language design is to share modules with other {\xml}
\twinalt{applications}{XML}{application}. For instance, formats like
{\docbook}~\cite{WalMue:dtdg99} or {\xhtml}~\cite{W3C:xhtml2000} could be extended with
the {\omdoc} statement level.  Including modules {\MOBJmodule{spec}}, {\METAmodule{spec}},
and (parts of) {\MTXTmodule{spec}}, but not {\RTmodule{spec}} and {\DOCmodule{spec}} would
result in content formats that mix the document-level structure of these formats.  Another
example is the combination of {\xmlrpc} envelopes and {\omdoc} documents used for
interoperability in {\extref{primer}{rpc}}.
