\begin{omgroup}[id=mobj-rnc]{The RelaxNG Schemata for Mathematical Objects}

For completeness we reprint the {\relaxng} schemata for the external formats
\omdoc makes use of.

\begin{omgroup}[id=rnc.openm]{The RelaxNG Schema for OpenMath}

For completeness we reprint the {\relaxng} schema for {\openmath}, the original can be
found in the {\openmath}3 standard under development\ednote{cite it when done}

\lstinputlisting[language=RNC,nolol,
index={OMS,OMV,OMI,OMB,OMSTR,OMF,OMA,OMBIND,OMBVAR,OME,OMATTR,OMATP}]
{../../schema/rnc/openmath/openmath3.rnc}
\end{omgroup}

\begin{omgroup}[id=rnc.mathml]{The RelaxNG Schema for MathML}

For completeness, we reprint the {\relaxng} schema for {\mathml}. It comes in three parts,
the schema driver with common parts, and the parts for content- and presentation {\mathml} which we will
present in the next two subsections.
