\begin{omgroup}[id=mobj,short=Mathematical Objects]
  {Mathematical Objects (Module {\MOBJmodule{spec}})}

  A distinguishing feature of mathematics is its ability to represent and manipulate ideas
  and objects in symbolic form as mathematical \indexalt{formulae}{formula}.  \omdoc uses
  the \openmath and \mathml formats to represent mathematical formulae and objects.
  Therefore, the {\openmath} standard~\cite{BusCapCar:2oms04} and the \mathml3
  recommendation~\cite{CarIon:MathML03} are part of this specification. \openmath and
  \mathml3 are well-aligned: the \cmathml sublanguage directly encodes \openmath
  objects. \mathml additionally has a sublanguage for expressing the layout of formulae:
  \pmathml, which can be mixed with \cmathml; therefore we prefer \mathml syntax for
  \omdoc and will use it throughout this specification. But we stress that \openmath
  syntax is supported in \omdoc as well.

  We will review {\openmath} objects in \sref{openmath} and {\cmathml} in \sref{cmml},
  and specify an \omdoc element for entering mathematical formulae (element
  \element{legacy}) in \sref{legacy}.  \ednote{discuss MathML3 and the relation between
    MathML and OpenMath and what that means for \omdoc}
