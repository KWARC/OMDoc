We present a variety of applications and projects that use the {\omdoc} format or are
related to it in a substantive way.

Apart from the projects directly reported here, the {\omdoc} format is used by the new
research field of {\atwintoo{Mathematical}{Knowledge}{Management}} ({\sc mkm};
cf.~\url{http://www.mkm-ig.org/}), which combines researchers in mathematics, computer
science, and library science. We refer the reader to the proceedings of the annual
{\sc{mkm}} conference~\cite{MKM01,MKM03,MKM04,MKM05,MKM06}.
