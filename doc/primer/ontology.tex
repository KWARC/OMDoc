\begin{omgroup}[id=ontology,creators={miko,clange}]{Documented Ontologies}

  {\omdoc} can be used for marking up ontologies. In particular, we use this for marking
  up the metadata ontologies, e.g. {\extref{spec}{dc-elements}}. Until we put a revised
  version here, please see~\cite{LK:MathOntoAuthDoc09}.
