  \DCMabstract{This document an easily approachable description of the {\omdoc} format by
    way of paradigmatic examples of {\omdoc} documents.  The primer should be used
    alongside the formal descriptions of the language contained in {\omdoc} specification.

    The intended audience for the primer are users who only need a casual exposure to the
    format, or authors that have a specific text category in mind.  The examples presented
    here also serve as specifications of ``best practice'', to give the readers an
    intuition for how to encode various kinds of mathematical knowledge.}
