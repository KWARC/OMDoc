\begin{omgroup}[id=preface,display=flow]{Preface}
  This \ifbook part of the {\report}\else document\fi provides an easily approachable
  description of the {\omdoc} format by way of paradigmatic examples of {\omdoc}
  documents.  The primer should be used alongside the formal descriptions of the language
  contained in {\extref{spec}{specification}}.

  The intended audience for the primer are users who only need a casual exposure to the
  format, or authors that have a specific text category in mind.  The examples presented
  here also serve as specifications of ``best practice'', to give the readers an intuition
  for how to encode various kinds of mathematical knowledge.
