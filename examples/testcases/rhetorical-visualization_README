The rhetoricalrelations.omdoc and rhetoricalrelations.xhtml files are the testcases for the rhetorical-visualization.xsl that can be found in /xsl2/varia/. 

* command for creating and running the testcases:

create the xhtml file from the omdoc file using the make command:

	make rhetoricalrelations.xhtml

run the XHTML testcase (rhetoricalrelation.xhtml in this case) on the XSL stylesheet (rhetorical-visualization.xsl), creating the output HTML file in the /examples/varia folder where the appropriate CSS stylesheet is at the moment:

	saxon rhetoricalrelations.xhtml ../../xsl2/varia/rhetorical-visualization.xsl > ../varia/rhetorical-visualization.html
